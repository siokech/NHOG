            <p class="intro about" style="text-align:left;">New House of Grace International (NHoGI) Ministries started in early 2015 as a house fellowship with Apostle Ken, his lovely wife Judy and a couple of brethren. Today, the ministry takes a tremendous stride in touching many lives globally. Launched officially in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2016, the church now has a coverage of over 15 branches globally. Apostle has footprints across the globe through the mentorship of pastors, evangelists, and many sons and daughters trained and commissioned to continue the works of God across various countries. NHoGI was put to an establishment in obedience to the apostolic and prophetic call of God on the man of God, the Apostle, and wholly supported by the first lady Rev. Judy. The ministerial work can be traced from as far as 1996, when Apostle Ken responded to the call to minister and actively served in various capacities, being mentored by one of the best fathers this land has known... <span class="more-text">It’s his submission to spiritual authority, the fear of God, and a burning desire to see souls saved that set the course for life and a pattern of ministry that would later birth the New House of Grace Ministries, following many years of sacrifice and service. Known throughout Kenya as a model for harmony and diversity, the NHoGI congregation is multi-generational and multi-ethnic with members from within and beyond the borders. Each week, NHoGI reaches thousands of people in Kakamega Kenya, and across various locations globally, through worship services, powerful sermons, wisdom classes, online TV & radio, and local missions. NHoGI’s heart for serving makes a tangible impact on the surrounding community through its outreach programs for hospitals, prisons, the unchurched, door-to-door evangelism, schools and university missions, and other outreaches...</span></p>

Kakamega, like many places, is not exactly an easy ground for the gospel, but by God’s grace we have been able to reach thousands with the message of Christ and we see the transformation and great deliverance in the lives of many.</p>
